United States Cancer Mortality Rates by County 1980-2014

IHME research used de-identified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population counts from the U.S. Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database and small area estimation models in order to estimate county-level mortality rates from 29 cancers. This dataset provides estimates for age-standardized mortality rates by cancer type and sex at the county level for each state, the District of Columbia, and the United States as a whole for 1980-2014, as well as the changes in rates for each location during this period. Also included are data on the 10 counties with the highest and lowest mortality rates for each cancer type in 2014 and the top 10 causes of death by cancer type for each county. Study results were published in JAMA in January 2017 in "Trends and patterns of disparities in cancer mortality among US counties, 1980-2014."
